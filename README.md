# cssi2020

This is a collection of all of the projects I worked on and completed daily during the Google Computer Science Summer Institute Online 2020. I used the p5 library and Javascript to code these projects. 

Worked collaboratively in a team of 3 to create an arcade of games. I coded the connect4 and balloon game. Check it out here: https://glitch.com/~arcadefinalproject
